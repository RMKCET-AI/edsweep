PROBLEM STATEMENT:
  
  Tele-Education is also known as e-learning which comprises all forms of electronically supported learning and teaching systems. E-learning content are available everywhere on the internet but there is not assessment of the quality of the content provided. Addressing this problem will help in having a tool which checks the quality of content provided in the e-learning course/video which will help in removing the ones not upto the mark.There is a requirement of a tool(Web,App,Standalone tool) which assesses the e-learning contents automatically as manual effort would not be possible with e-learning contents spanning more than 1Billion videos on youtube itself. 1. How can we have a digital tool to assess the efficacy of tele-education happening through TV in terms of assessment of teaching and learning?
